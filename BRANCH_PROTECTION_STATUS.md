# Branch Protection Test

This file is created to test branch protection rules.

## Current Status Check:

1. **Branch `develop`**: ❌ Not protected yet (manual setup required)
2. **Branch `main`**: ❌ Not protected yet (manual setup required)

## How to Verify Protection is Active:

### After Manual Setup:
1. Try to push directly to develop branch - should be blocked
2. Create feature branch and PR - should require approval
3. CI checks should be required before merge

### Test Commands:
```bash
# This should fail after protection is enabled
git checkout develop
echo "test" >> test.txt
git add test.txt
git commit -m "test direct push"
git push origin develop  # Should be rejected

# This should work
git checkout -b feature/test-protection
git push origin feature/test-protection
# Then create PR via GitHub UI
```
