# Feature Branch Workflow Test

This demonstrates the proper way to contribute code:

1. Create feature branch from develop ✅
2. Make changes ✅  
3. Push feature branch ✅
4. Create Pull Request (manual via GitHub UI)
5. Get approval (if required)
6. Merge via PR

This workflow should work properly even with branch protection active.
